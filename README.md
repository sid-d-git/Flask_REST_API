# Flask_REST_API


    REST API for Video Management
This project demonstrates the creation of a RESTful API using Flask and Flask-RESTful. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on video data, showcasing my ability to design, implement, and test a backend API.  

 Functions
• CRUD Operations: Supports adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting video records.  
• Database Integration: Utilizes SQLite for persistent data storage with SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).  
• Error Handling: Handles edge cases like duplicate or non-existent video IDs gracefully.  
• Scalability: Implements clean and modular code structure for scalability and maintainability.  
• Testing:Includes a separate test script (`test.py`) for automated testing using the Python `requests` library.  


 Tools & Environment
• Replit (Mobile Version): The entire project was developed on Replit's mobile platform, demonstrating my ability to adapt and code on-the-go.

• Hoppscotch: Used for testing API endpoints and verifying their functionality.  


  How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed (`Flask`, `Flask-RESTful`, `Flask-SQLAlchemy`).  
3. Run `main.py` to start the API server.  
4. Use `test.py` or tools like Hoppscotch/Postman to test the API endpoints.  
 

  About Me
I'm an 18-year-old currently diving into the world of web development. Through this project, I’ve strengthened my understanding of REST APIs and backend development. Learning on Replit’s mobile platform and testing with Hoppscotch challenged me to think creatively and solve problems effectively.  


I'm actively seeking opportunities to grow as a web developer. If this project interests you or you have suggestions, please feel free to reach out:
